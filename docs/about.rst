Scoring Engine for CTF competitions https://github.com/dichotomy/scorebot

Scorebot is a scoring engine for CTF competitions. It is built upon a Blue Team / Red Team model, where Blue Teams defend flags against Red teams. (Blue Teams may also attack other Blue Teams to steal flags). Scoring is based upon flags stolen, scored service up time, and injects submitted (there is no scoring tracking for injects yet).

BUGS Yes, there are bugs. These will be documented later. ;)
